# Plan and Brainstorming

1.  When user enter query words, ask GPT to generate a more concise and
several other options of query words that will be entered to the search engine. This is to get more results (So, we are going to have several iterations of search query). =>
- Use a combination of primary keywords, synonyms, and related terms 
- Include date ranges (e.g., "latest", "past week", "2023") to ensure the results are up-to-date
- Use boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to refine searches

e.g. for a case about data privacy breaches, we might use:
i)      "data privacy breach news"
ii)     "latest data security incidents"
iii)    "2023 cyber attacks on personal data"
iv)     "data breach legal cases 2023"
v)      "privacy violation court rulings"

2.  After having the query word, we then can go web scraping to the websites, then extracting the obtained data to a readable PDF/xls file for the user to get any information.

- Include metadata like the publication date, author, and source for each article
- Categorize articles based on relevance, tone, or specific mentions (e.g., client names, specific laws)
- Implement error handling and retries for failed requests

e.g. Create a structured format in XLS with columns for Title, Link, Summary, Publication Date, Source, Relevance Score, and Sentiment Analysis.

3. In the other hand, maybe we can also generate some data so that we can upload to GPT and GPT can have a review and can explain to the user about the obtained data. The file that will be uploaded to GPT must not be too big, max of 512 MB per file or 20 MB per photo. At most, we can only upload 20 filles for each GPT.

- Automate the summarization of large datasets to extract key points and trends
- Use GPT to generate summaries, key insights, and potential legal implications from the scraped data
- Provide interactive features where users can ask specific questions about the data

e.g. Upload a concise CSV file containing key data points, and use GPT to generate a summary report highlighting trends, key articles, and their implications.

Additional Ideas :
1) Advanced Search Customization:

Allow users to specify the types of sources to prioritize (e.g., legal journals, major news outlets, industry blogs).
Provide options for geographic filters to focus on news from specific regions or countries.

2) Sentiment Analysis:

Implement sentiment analysis to gauge the tone of news articles. This can help in understanding public perception and media bias.
Categorize articles into positive, neutral, and negative sentiment.

3) Trend Analysis:

Track the frequency of specific keywords over time to identify emerging trends or spikes in media coverage.
Visualize these trends using graphs and charts in the final report.

4) Alerts and Notifications:

Set up automated alerts for new articles matching the specified criteria. These alerts can be sent via email or integrated into a dashboard.
Provide real-time notifications for critical updates.

5) Integration with Legal Databases:

Cross-reference news articles with legal databases to find related case laws or statutes.
Provide links to relevant legal documents and case summaries.

6) User-Friendly Interface:

Develop a user-friendly interface where law firm staff can input queries, view results, and download reports.
Include search filters and sorting options to refine the results.
